# Schiffe_versenken_GUI
Very first Java Project - Battleship

The very first Java project build by a colleague and myself. 
Its a very simple Swing-GUI and was mostly for us to check if we understood some java elements.

This might not the most professional code but we were actually pretty happy 
to build our very first simple game from scratch.

It got me even more hooked into programming so it deserves to be here in my GitHub.
